# Sparkify: Predicting Churn for a Music Streaming Service

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PySpark SQL
 - PySpark ML

## Project Motivation
Prediction of customer churn for a fictional music streaming company: Sparkify.

The project involved:
 - Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
 - Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
 - Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
 - Modelling using machine learning algorithms

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook and html file of the notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn.

## Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://derekma666.medium.com/churn-prediction-in-sparkify-with-pyspark-2b1ad45db989) explaining the details.


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
I'd like to acknowledge Udacity for the project idea and workspace.
