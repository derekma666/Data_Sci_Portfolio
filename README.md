### Project 1 - Data Science Blog

**Description:** 

In this project, a dataset from Kaggle (Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data) was adopted to investigate the global climate changes. The project notebook could be found as follows:

### Project 2 - Disaster Response Pipeline

**Description:**

In this project, disaster data were analyzed from Figure Eight to build a model for an API which classifies disaster messages.

The datasets adopted real messages that were sent during disaster events. A machine learning pipline with multi-output classifier were built to categorize these event to reach out for a relevant relief agency.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. The project notebook could be found below
