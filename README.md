# Data Science Portfolio

### Project 1 - Data Science Blog (Medium)

**Description:** 

In this project, a dataset from **Kaggle (Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data)** was adopted to investigate the global climate changes. The project notebook could be found as follows:

### Project 2 - Disaster Response Pipeline (Machine Learning)

**Description:**

In this project, disaster data were analyzed to build a model for an API which classifies disaster messages.

The datasets adopted real messages which were sent during disaster events. A machine learning pipline with multi-output classifier were built to categorize these event to reach out for a relevant relief agency.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. The project notebook could be found below

### Project 3 - Recommendation System Design

**Description:**

In this project, users' interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform were comprehensively analysed, and a recommendation system was built to recommend new articles to the users who would like to read.

### Project 4 Spark Distributed Analytics (Big Data)

**Description:**

In the capstone project, I built a distributed machine learning tool for a user log using spark - the big data technology toolkit. The primary objective was to predict the churning possibilities of every user.
