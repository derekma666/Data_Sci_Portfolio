# Global climate change risks: warming analysis

**Project Motivation**

In this project, a dataset from Kaggle (Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data) was adopted (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) to investigate the global climate changes.
In this data blog, three key questions are raised as follows:

* 1. How the temperature changes in each season? 
* 2. What's temperature difference in each country in the dataset?
* 3. When did global warming started?

**Installation**

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* plotly

**File Descriptions**

* data: it contains data files of global climate data named with conventions of "GlobalTemperatures.csv" and "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv"
* Climate.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for the main analytics

**Results**

Primary findings of the code can be found at the Jupyter Notebook and blog post as follows.
