## Project Motivation
In this project, users' interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform were comprehensively analysed, and a recommendation system was built to recommend new articles to the users who would like to read. The project was divided into following tasks:

 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Rank Based Recommendations
 - User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
 - Matrix factorisation
