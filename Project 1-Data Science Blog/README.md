# Global climate change risks: warming analysis

**Project Motivation**

The assessment of the effects of climate change on the natural environment challenges the scientific community and poses thought-provoking problems to decision makers and politicians. Global warming is unequivocal, but the effects of global warming, and the related changes in climate, on geo-hydrological hazards (e.g., floods, landslides, droughts), important infrastructures, and global economy remain difficult to determine, and to predict. There is the need to understand and measure global climate variables and their seaonal variability.

In this project, a dataset from Kaggle (Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data) was adopted (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) to investigate the global climate changes.

In this data blog, three key questions are raised as follows:

* 1. How the temperature changes in each season? 
* 2. What's temperature difference in each country in the dataset?
* 3. When did global warming started?

**Installation**

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* plotly

**File Descriptions**

* Data: it contains data files of global climate data named with conventions of "GlobalTemperatures.csv" and "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv"
* Climate.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for the main analytics

**Results**

Primary findings of the code can be found at the Jupyter Notebook and blog post as follows:
